            <p>I’m a St. Cloud State University graduate with a major in Mass Communications Advertising and a minor in Graphic Design. I was a board member for an organization called Hmong Student Organization during college which helped build my leadership skills. I received a certificate in web development after finishing a 12 week coding Bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. It was an amazing experience learning web development and computer programming. I’m ready to use the skills that I have learned through the course and create future projects. </p>
